1. Minimise the pain

    - No one likes filling in forms.
    - Use smart defaults, inline validation and forgiving inputs.

2. Illuminate the path to completion

    - Through orientation, progress bars, for example

3. Consider the context

    - Bear in mind whether form elements will be familiar or foreign to users.
    - Also consider if the element is used or rarely used.

4. Ensure consistent communication

    - Errors, help and success
    - Use a single voice, despite many stakeholders

5. Highlight optional fields only

    - Most fields will be mandatory, so only highlight what is optional
